    Thanks for your interest in the %{tour_name}.
    Here you are right to enroll yourself or other players for the tournament. To do this you must provide an e-mail
    address, but you may also create an inscription form by merely providing a name.

  help_para1: |
    In order to enroll yourself to the %{tournament_name} you first have to create an inscription form.
    This is a simple process during which we can verify your e-mail address such that we can contact you
    if questions arise concerning your inscriptions.
    Please create an inscription using the form on the %{start_html} either with your licence number
    (in which case the program can look up your name) or by providing a name.
  help_para2: |
    If you do have a licence by Swiss Table Tennis it is most simple to provide your licence number which
    allows the program to look up your name and club in the database. If you like to use a nickname you
    may still provide it in the name field. If you do not have a licence or do not want to provide it it
    is also possible (though a little less convenient) to just use your name in the inscription form.
  new_login_link: new login-Link
  help_para3: |
    After your inscription has been saved we will send you an e-mail with a confirmation-link. It will contain
    a random number which serves as your login for this inscription so you do not have to remember a password.
    Please keep your confirmation e-mail because it allows you to easily manage and edit your inscriptions.
    Since the link will only be valid until up to the end of the tournament you may also pass it to someone
    else, e.g. if you leave for the holiday. Of course we will provide a %{new_login_link} if you
    accidentially lost your confirmation-link. Note however that any old links immediately become invalid
    as soon as you askt for a new one, therefore it is pointless to ask for more than one in succession.
  help_para4: |
    Using your confirmation-link you you can easily check all your inscriptions, but we will also send you
    an e-mail about any changes made to your inscription. So if you add a player or change his series we
    will send you an e-mail about each edit. Usually you are responsible for these edits, but it will also
    permit you to react quickly in case of fraud.

    If you have further questions or comments you may %{email_link}.
