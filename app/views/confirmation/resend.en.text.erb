<%=@inscription.anrede%> <%=@inscription.name%>

Your new login link is now

<%= login_url(:host=>@host, :id => @inscription.id, :token => @inscription.password) %>

With just one click you may administer your inscription and add or remove players to/from it.

Please keep this e-mail ut to the tournament, the link will stay active that long.
<% unless @inscription.tournament.facebook_link.blank? %>
You may also use our Facebook page

<%=@inscription.tournament.facebook_link%>

to stay up-to-date with the tournament.
<% end %>

Sincerely

the <%=@inscription.tournament.name%> team

P.S.: With the delivery of the new login link the old one becomes invalid.
Should you already have requested a new one before receiving the intermediary one that one might not work either as it is always just the last link that remains active.
For this reasen we ask for a little patience.
